that work on Windows.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Test::Approvals::Reporters::MyCoolReporter;

    use strict;
    use warnings FATAL => 'all';

    {
        use version; our $VERSION = qv('v0.0.4_1');
        use Moose;

        with 'Test::Approvals::Reporters::Win32Reporter';

        with 'Test::Approvals::Reporters::EnvironmentAwareReporter';

        sub exe {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a common base for reporters on Windows.  By extending this
class, you get a search strategy for locating your reporter, and you don't have
to worry about the details of launching a detatched child process.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 default_argv

    my $argv = $reporter->default_argv();

Retrieve the shell arguments commonly used by diff utilities.

=head2 launch

    my $received = 'test.received.txt';
    my $approved = 'test.approved.txt';
    $reporter->launch($received, $approved);

Create a detached Windows process for the diff utility, passing the new process
the arguments required to compare the approved file with the received file.

=head2 locate_exe

    # Path within "Program Files"
    my $relative_path = 'DiffUtilMaker/SuperDiff';

    # Diff utility executable name
    my $exe = 'SuperDiffUtil.exe';

    my $exe_path = locate_exe($relative_path, $exe);

Search for $exe on the path, and in common locations.  If not found, hope that 
it's underneath the Windows "Program Files" directory.

=head2 report

    my $received = 'test.received.txt';
    my $approved = 'test.approved.txt';
    $reporter->report($received, $approved);

Normalize the paths to received and approved files, then try to launch the diff
utility.
