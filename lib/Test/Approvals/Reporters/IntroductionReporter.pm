Welcome to ApprovalTests for Perl (Test::Approvals).
ApprovalTests use a reporter to show you results when your test fails.
For example, you could use a diff tool, or simply display the output.
You can find several reporters under Test::Approvals::Reporters, or 
create your own by implementing the Test::Approvals::Reporters::Reporter 
role.
