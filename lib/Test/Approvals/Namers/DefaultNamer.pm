Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer - Default algorithm for generating names

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer version v0.0.4_1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # C:/usr/example.pl

    use Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer;

    my $n = Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer->new(
        directory => 'c:\tmp',
        name      => 'foo'
    );

    my $x = $n->get_approved_file('txt'); # C:\tmp\example.pl.foo.approved.txt
    my $y = $n->get_received_file('txt'); # C:\tmp\example.pl.foo.received.txt

    # Cleans the input when necessary
    my $o = Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer->new(
        directory => 'c:/tmp/',
        name      => 'foo.'
    );

    # Still C:\tmp\example.pl.foo.received.txt
    my $z = $o->get_received_file('.txt'); 

    # Uses current script directory by default
    my $p = Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer->new( name => 'foo' );

    # Now C:\usr\example.pl.foo.approved.txt
    my $a = $p->get_approved_file('txt'); 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The DefaultNamer class contains an algorithm for generating names for files
to store test results in.  It also provides easy access to the name of the 
test it is associated with.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 get_approved_file

    my $n = Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer->new(
        directory => 'c:\tmp',
        name      => 'foo'
    );
    my $path = $n->get_approved_file('txt');

Generate the full path to the approved file.  In the example above $path will
be assigned: 'C:\tmp\<script>.foo.approved.txt', where <script> is the name of
the caller's script (similar to the output of FindBin::Real::Script)

=head2 get_received_file

    my $n = Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer->new(
        directory => 'c:\tmp',
        name      => 'foo'
    );
    my $path = $n->get_received_file('txt');

Generate the full path to the received file.  In the example above $path will
be assigned: 'C:\tmp\<script>.foo.received.txt', where <script> is the name of
the caller's script (similar to the output of FindBin::Real::Script)

=head2 get_filename

    my $n = Test::Approvals::Namers::DefaultNamer->new(
        directory => 'c:\tmp',
        name      => 'foo'
    );
    my $path = $n->get_filename('txt', 'bar');

Generate the full path to the requested file of the requested type.  In the 
example above $path will be assigned: 'C:\tmp\<script>.foo.bar.txt', where 
<script> is the name of the caller's script (similar to the output of 
FindBin::Real::Script)
