=head1 NAME

Test::Approvals - Capture human intelligence in your tests

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Test::Approvals version v0.0.4_10

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Approvals qw(use_reporter verify_ok);

    use_reporter('Test::Approvals::Reporters::DiffReporter');
    verify_ok 'Hello', 'Hello Test';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Test::Approvals modules provides the top level interface to ApprovalTestss
for Perl.  You can use ApprovalTests to verify objects that require more than 
a simple assert, including long strings, large arrays, and complex hash
structures and objects.  Perl already has great modules that overlap with 
ApprovalTests, but Test::Approvals really shines when you take advantage of
reporters to provide different views into failing tests.  Sometimes printing to 
STDOUT just isn't enough.  

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 namer

    my $namer = namer();

Gets the currently configured Test::Approvals::Namers:: instance.

=head2 reporter

    my $reporter = reporter();

Gets the currently configured Test::Approvals::Reporters:: instance.

=head2 use_name

    my $namer = use_name('My Test Name');

Construct a namer for the specified name, configure it as the current instance, 
and return the instance.

=head2 use_name_in

    my $namer = use_name_in('My Test Name', 'C:\tests\approvals\');

Like 'use_name', but names will be generated in the specified folder.

=head2 use_reporter

    my $reporter = use_reporter('Test::Approvals::Reporters::DiffReporter');

Construct a reporter of the specified type, configure it as the current 
instance, and return the instance.

=head2 use_reporter_instance

    my $reporter = Test::Approvals::Reporters::DiffReporter->new();
    my $ref = use_reporter_instance($reporter);

Like 'use_reporter', but use the provided instance instead of constructing a 
new instance.

=head2 verify

    my $ok = verify('Hello');
    ok $ok, 'My Test';

Construct a writer for the specified data and use it (along with the current 
namer and reporter instances) to verify against the approved data.  Returns a
value indicating whether the data matched.  The reporter is launched when 
appropriate.

You can pass anything to verify that Perl can easily stringify in a scalar 
context.  So, passing an array, a hash, or raw reference to verify is not going 
to produce useful results.  In these cases, take advantage of verify_dump.

=head2 verify_ok

    use_name('Hello Test');
    verify_ok('Hello');

Like 'verify', but also automatically call 'ok' with the test name provided by
the current namer instance.  Or you can pass the name explicitly for a more
traditional Test::More experience:

    verify_ok 'Hello', 'Hello Test';

=head2 verify_dump

    use_name('Person Test');
    my %person = ( First => 'Fred', Last => 'Flintrock' );
    verify_dump \%person;

Like 'verify_ok', but will call Data::Dumper::Dumper on the reference for you.
Because hash keys are not ordered, and therefore not guaranteed to be stable 
across runs, this method will enable key sorting inside Data::Dumper using 
$Data::Dumper::Sortkeys = 1.  Before returning, it restores Sortkeys to it's
previous value.
